# HomeyESP32BluetoothKeyboard
ESP32 firmware to let the Homey communicate like a Bluetooth keyboard to Bluetooth devices.
Compatible with Android, Windows, Linux, iOS that support Bluetooth LE. (iPad 4 and higher, iPhone 4S and higher. (These support BLE))

This firmware is aimed to lock and unlock an iPad, but you can change the On / off setting for anything you want: space to unlock (or with code) and CTRL+CMD+h to lock. You can change the keyboard shortcuts in the routine setPowerOnOff (for use with Android). You can also send complete strings, or keystrokes from Homey.

**You need these libraries:**
https://github.com/athombv/com.athom.homeyduino
https://github.com/T-vK/ESP32-BLE-Keyboard
https://github.com/Brunez3BD/WIFIMANAGER-ESP32  (This one works with the ESP32)

Arduino version I used: 1.8.9
ESP 32 used: ESP32 Dev Module
Partition scheme: Huge App (3MB no OTA/1MB SPIFFS) Otherwise it won't fit the RAM

**Usage:**
Add Homeyduino on Homey.
Switch (on / off) locks and unlocks iOS devices. 
You can also use actions in flows with "SendText" to let the ESP32 type a complete string of text or..
Use "SendKey" to send a single (special) key. see keyLookupTable below for supported keys. Or a single character.
"SendKey" keeps the key pressed (so you can send things like Alt+Ctrl+delete) So you need to send the SendKey RELEASE after the SendKeys to release the keys (with a second delay).
Otherwise it will automatically release it after the releaseTime timeout. Use only one keystroke per card.
It includes a wifi manager to connect to an wifi network. Just connect a phone to the "Homey Bluetooth Keyboard" network and fill in the credentials. (No hardcoding of credentials, so you donâ€™t have to find the source code if you change the wifi network after a couple of years ;))

**NOTE:**
There's a big bug somewhere. I suspect the Bluetooth or the BLE library causes an Stack overflow error. This happens when you send Bluetooth commands at a high rate. 
It's not really a problem, the ESP32 resets and connects immediately after that. But if anyone knows how to solve it, please let me know!
